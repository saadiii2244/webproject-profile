# Portfolio (HTML & CSS Only)

A multi-page, responsive portfolio built for CS 311 – Web Programming (Summer 2025).

## Pages
- `index.html` – Home (intro + navbar)
- `about.html` – About Me (bio + photo + timeline using `<table>`)
- `projects.html` – At least 3 projects in responsive cards

## Tech & Features
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Flexbox & Grid
- Responsive: Desktop (3 cols) → Tablet (2 cols) → Mobile (1 col)
- CSS animations (fade-in cards, hover scaling on buttons)
- Reusable navbar on every page

## How to Deploy with GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repository (public).
2. Upload all files from the `portfolio/` folder (keep the same structure).
3. In **Settings → Pages**, set **Branch** = `main` (or `master`) and **Root`** (not `docs`).
4. Save; wait for the green link to appear (your live site URL).

## Replace Images
- Put your own photo at `images/profile.jpg` (square looks best).
- Replace `images/project1.jpg`, `images/project2.jpg`, `images/project3.jpg` with your project images.

## Screenshots for PDF
After your site is live:
- Take screenshots of Home, About, Projects.
- Replace the placeholder images in the PDF (optional), or resubmit a PDF with your actual screenshots.
